# Python Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains questions requiring implementation of  data structures and algorithms concepts. It is useful for interviews in Python.

## Objective

The open source community has helped me a lot during my interview preparations and studies while I was in my undergrad. I always wanted to give something back to the community. In my endeavour to contribute something back, I will be uploading data structures and algorithms questions in Python in this repo. Feel free to contribute and get in touch! :smiley:

## Structure of the repository

As of now, the repository contains 3 main directories: [**Bookmarks**](bookmarks), [**Data Structures**](data_structures) and [**Algorithms**](algorithms).

### Data Structures

Contains all data structure questions categorised into sub-directories like stack, queue, etc according to their type.

1. [Array](data_structures/array)
2. [Dictionary]()
3. [Binary Search Tree](data_structures/bst)
4. [Linked List](data_structures/linked_list)
5. [Stack](data_structures/stack)
6. [Graphs](data_structures/graphs)
7. [Circular Linked List](data_structures/circular_linked_list)
8. [Doubly Linked List](data_structures/doubly_linked_list)

### Algorithms

This directory contains various types of algorithm questions like Dynamic Programming, Sorting, Greedy, etc. The current structure of this directory is like -

1. [Dynamic Programming](algorithms/dynamic_programming)
2. [Graphs](algorithms/graph)
3. [Greedy](algorithms/greedy)
4. [Math](algorithms/math)
5. [Misc](algorithms/miscellaneous)
6. [Sorting](algorithms/sorting)
7. [Bit Manipulation](algorithms/bit_manipulation)

### Bookmarks

## Things need to be done

As you can see, the repo is still in its infancy. Here are some key things in the to-do.

1. Queue questions
2. Algorithms
3. More questions in data structures, especially for graph, circular linked list, trees, heaps and hash.
